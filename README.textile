h3. Gazehound!

h3. Archived

This library should probably not be used by literally anyone. It is very old and there are better methods out there.

h3. Intro

Gazehound is a (rather skeletal) library designed to perform scientific
analyses on eyetracking data. Currently, it mostly works with data 
generated by the iView system from SMI, and will be expanded to work with
data from the Tobii eyetracker as well.

More docs coming soon. Soon-ish.
